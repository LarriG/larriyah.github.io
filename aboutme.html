        <p>I attend Hudson highschool of Learning Technologies and am a rising 9th grader interesting in coding. I found ScriptEd through my school and took it as an elective class. Since then I've been give a multitude of opportunities such as <Hello/Girl>, Hackaton and the advance class. Each opportunity that I am given I do to the best of my ability and willpower. After all that I have achieved, I’d consider myself a novice at coding, my knowledge on the topic is ever expanding with each class I take and every new peer I meet. Though I code often, I tend to dabble in artistic mediums, painting, sketching and more, I hope that coding can help me further my craft and create something I could’ve only imagined. My carrer goals are to become an animator, graphic designer or game designer. Having both skills will enable me to reach greater limits and expectations to reach these goals.</p>
